# SoilGeneHS 

Project objective: Get a (robust as possible) subset of the most important wavebands for predicting soil gene abundance values.

Constraints:
1. Python instead of R
2. Only elastic net models (random forest had bad results previously, and elastic net is a generalization of lasso models so those are implicitly included in consideration)
